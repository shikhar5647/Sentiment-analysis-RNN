# Sentiment Analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Introduction

This project implements sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with TensorFlow. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment of a given text, and in this case, we classify movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Theory

Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing and has numerous applications such as understanding customer feedback, social media monitoring, and market analysis. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks particularly effective for sequential data processing tasks like sentiment analysis. RNNs are capable of capturing contextual information and dependencies within sequences, making them well-suited for tasks involving text data.

## Dataset

The IMDB dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews split evenly into training and testing sets. Each review is preprocessed and encoded as a sequence of integers, with corresponding labels indicating positive or negative sentiment.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation
